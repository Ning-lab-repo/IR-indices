# Machine learning-based comparison and optimization of TyG, TyG-BMI and TG/HDL-C indices
This repository contains the code and scripts associated with the article titled "Machine learning-based comparison and optimization of TyG, TyG-BMI, and TG/HDL-C indices for short- and long-term mortality prediction in critically ill stroke patients".

## Background
Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, particularly among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), where prognosis remains poor. Insulin resistance (IR) has been recognized as a significant risk factor for stroke, with alternative IR markers-the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, TyG-body mass index (TyG-BMI), and triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C)-demonstrating strong predictive capabilities. While prior studies have highlighted the association between these IR indices and all-cause mortality (ACM) in critically ill stroke patients, the optimal index for prognostic prediction remains unclear.  

## Conclusions
This study is the first to compare the predictive value of IR indices for short- and long-term mortality in critically ill stroke patients, elucidating that the TyG functions as a significant independent predictor of short-term mortality, whereas the TyG-BMI as a robust predictor of the long term. The machine learning models developed in this investigation demonstrate suitability for clinical application, which underscores the substantial implications of these findings for personalized risk assessment and the prognostic management of stroke patients.
